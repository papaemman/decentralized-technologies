INSTRUCTIONS: Install Bitcoin Core
===================================


// HOW TO: Interact with bitcoint network //

- Bitcoin GUI (graphical user interface)
- Bitcoin cli (command line interface)

---------------------------------------------------

// HOW TO: Install bitcoin //

1. Install the package

- Download bitcoin core setup .exe file from https://bitcoin.org/en/download
- Run bitcoin-0.19.0.1-win64-setup.exe file and install bitcoin


2. Create configuration file

- Create a file bitcoin.conf inside C:\Users\Panagiotis\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin path
- Edit it to enable regtest and expose JSON-RPC

Copy paste inside bitcoin.conf file the following:
regtest=1
server=1
rpcuser=panagiotis
rpcpassword=papas1996

Note: Don't run Bitcoin core or Bitcoin core (test-net) programms,
because these programms will download the entire blockchain history of the main-net / test-net respectively.
(I want to experiment with resnet, instead.)

// How to run a bitcoin node (resnet) //

--> How to start bitcoin server: Run the bitcoin daemon

1. Open a cmd and run the commands:

- cd C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\daemon (to navigate to the folder)

- bitcoind                           (to run the daemon server)

Note: The above commands starts a bitcoin node in regtest
      (because of the parameters in the bitcoin.conf file)
      Keep in mind that cmd must be up and running in order to interact wtih bictoin network.

If you see "Adding fixed seed nodes as DNS doesn't seem to be available.", then 
- open another cmd at the same directory and start playing using bitcoin-cli commands.

Note: The new cmd must be in the same directory with the bitcoind programm,
      to be able to interact with it.

---------------------------------------------------------
 
// How do I reset bitcoin regtest mode //

- Delete the Bitcoin Core datadir, at C:\Users\Panagiotis\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\regtest
