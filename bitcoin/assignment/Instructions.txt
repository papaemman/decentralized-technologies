====================
script_1.py
====================

// Task //
Define a public key (or private key) and a locktime
and create a P2SH address.

RUN:
$ python script_1.py
and follow the orders, to get the P2SH address.


====================
script_2.py
====================

// TASK //
Allow someone to spend all funds from P2SH address defined in script_1.


Notes:

Before starting the script 2,

1. make sure that you have sent some BTC to P2SH address,
otherwise, you will get an error message that this address has no funds available.

2. make sure that there is a local bitcoin node running,

3. make sure that the transactions sending funds to the P2SH address have been mined (at least 1 confirmation).
   Otherwise, the script will not be able to find these transactions.
   You can change this, from the first argument in line 129.

4.  make sure that the locktime specified for this P2SH has passed,
    or you will get an error.

At the end of the script, if everything goes right, you will get the txid,
for the required transaction.

RUN:
$ python script_2.py
and follow the orders, to spend all the funds from this P2SH address to another address.
